# ALU project in Digital Logic Sim[^1]

> My project is to make an ALU in Digital Logic Sim. By doing this project I will learn how does computer work. After doing that i will extend the project until I have a fully functional computer in the Simulation. And all of this project started with only an NAND gate. If you want to see my progress, all the chips i used are in the scr folder.

## Introduction
This project is my first GitHub repository, i do this to learn how to do a github repository and how does computer work, if you want to learn how does computer work I recomand [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq&si=9D6MCIPkoR6OPrXW) series by Sebastian Lague, the simulation that i am using for this is from him. You can see the progression of the project with the picture below and the upcoming feature with the road map.

## Roadmap
### Basic ALU
- [x] Making the logics gates
- [x] Creating a basic 1-bit adder
- [x] Creating a 7 to 8-bit adder
- [x] Making the adder be able to andle negative number with a new bit
- [x] Creating a one-bit storage
- [x] Transforming it into a 256 octets memory
- [ ] Creating an ALU chip that can use an adress to do an action using the 256 octets memory
### Visual
- [x] Making a circuit which can take a 4-bit number (capped at 9) and transforming it in 8 bits that can be taken by 7 segment display
- [x] Making it be able to show negative (and change color)
- [x] Making the display be connectible and removing the extra zero (on toggle)
- [x] Making the display move the negative sign (-)
- [x] Isolating the hundreds out of a 8-bit number
- [ ] Isolating the tens out of a 8-bit number
- [ ] Isolating the ones out of a 8-bit number
## What is Digital Logic Sim[^1] ?
Digital logic Sim is a minimalistic digital logic simulator. You can create various chips starting with a NAND gate, from there you can go the whole way to a little computer !
