# alu project in Digital Logic Sim

## Roadmap
- [x] Making the logics gates
- [x] Creating a basic 1-bit adder
- [x] Creating a 7 to 8-bit adder
- [x] Making the adder be able to andle negative number with a new bit
- [x] creating a one-bit storage
- [x] transforming it into a 256 octets memory
### Visual
- [x] Making a circuit which can take a 4-bit number (capped at 9) and transforming it in 8 bits that can be taken by 7 segment display
- [x] Making it be able to show negative (and change color)
- [x] Making the display be connectible and removing the extra zero (on toggle)
- [x] Making the display move the negative sign (-)
- [x] Isolating the hundreds out of a 8-bit number
- [ ] Isolating the tens out of a 8-bit number
- [ ] Isolating the unit out of a 8-bit number
